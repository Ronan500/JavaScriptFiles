/*
You can run the same code multiple times by
using a loop. The next type of loop you will
learn is called a "do...while" loop because
it first will "do" one pass of the code inside
the loop no matter what, and then it runs "while"
 a specified condition is true and stops once that
 condition is no longer true. Let's look at an example.
